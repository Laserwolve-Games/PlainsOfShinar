- **Entity Management**: Modular entity system with collision detection and pathfinding
- **Web-Based**: Runs directly in modern web browsers with WebGPU support
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ES6 modules

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with WebGPU support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Laserwolve-Games/PlainsOfShinar.git
cd PlainsOfShinar
```

2. Start a local web server:
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have serve installed)
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`main.js`**: Entry point and game initialization
- **`globals.js`**: Global game state, utilities, and configuration
- **`entity.js`**: Base entity class with animation and collision systems
- **`player.js`**: Player-specific logic and controls
- **`pathfindingWorker.js`**: Web Worker for pathfinding calculations

### Key Features

- **Isometric Projection**: Custom isometric transformation system
- **Grid-Based Movement**: 64x64 cell grid system for positioning
- **Collision Detection**: SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) collision detection
- **Animation System**: Sprite sheet-based animation with multiple states
- **Asset Management**: Efficient loading and caching of game assets

## üé® Assets

The game includes comprehensive sprite sheets for character animations:

- **Idle**: Breathing and standing animations

Each animation includes both the character model and corresponding shadow sprites.

## üîß Configuration

Key configuration values in `globals.js`:

- **Layout**: 4096x2048 isometric layout
- **Cell Size**: 64x32 pixel cells
- **Isometry Factor**: 0.5 for proper isometric projection
- **Grid Size**: Dynamic based on layout dimensions
